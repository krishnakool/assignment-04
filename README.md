# <YOUR_FIRST_NAME><YOUR_LAST_NAME>

# Assignment 4
In this Assignment you will be implementing Greedy Search and A-star Search.
Please change the <YOUR_FIRST_NAME> and <YOUR_LAST_NAME> tags of this file accordingly and please read the PDF file in this repository to get an idea of the problem statement.

## Coding Guidelines
* Please use .py files provided to code your solutions in **Python 3.5 or above**.
* A minimalistic template is provided so that you can organize your ideas and put them into the appropriate functions.
* Please **fill out the docstrings** (function args and return value type and description) after implementation.
* Please **fill out the requirements.txt** if you are using any third party python libraries (Eg: numpy).
* Please add **travis build status label** in markdown format at the top of the README.md. Follow the instructions https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/
* Please add any extra functions if needed in the helper.py.
* Do not clutter your code and try to be more Pythonic in coding.
* Kindly use meaningful identifiers for variable/function/class names. Also add comments to help us easily evaluate your code.

## Deliverables
* Please create a results folder and store the results of greedy search and A-star search in a manually created output.txt file.
* The txt file should compulsarily contain **the initial board configuration, the intermediate configurations and the final board configuration** and the **time taken** by the search algorithm and other details as mentioned in the pdf.
* The intermediate configuration of the board must also be printed on the console so that the swapping of the tiles is clearly visible.
* Answers to the theoretical questions must be uploaded in a **single pdf file** inside the results folder with naming conventions as in LEA (AI_04_LastName_FirstName.pdf)

#### A Failure to adhere to the above instructions Will result in a loss of points.

## Additional Details
**Please add any details which we will need for running and test your code.**





## Getting started with the assignment
* Clone the repository by first clicking on the green button on the top right to copy the https or ssh link and using the command,
```
git clone <copied link>
```
* Start working on your assignment in your local machine and once you are ready to update your changes on github use the following commands,
```
git add <some-file>
```
```
git commit -m "<give your commit message here within the double quotes>"
```
* It is good practice to often check the status of your staged or committed file using
```
git status
```
* To push your changes to the github repo use,
```
git push origin master
```
